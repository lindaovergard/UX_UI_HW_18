                    Designer of User Experiences and Graphic Designer that specializes in digital experiences as well as the printed medium.<br><br>
                    I approach the design process with patience and curiosity, and love problem solving.<br><br>
                    What drives me is the constant opportunity to learn and to get to know people, dive deeper into my users needs and identify their pain points, which allows me to create and iterate tools and experiences that are personal and effortless.</p>
